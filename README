stacktile is a layout generator for the river[1] Wayland compositor.

It devides the screen into three areas, the primary area, the secondary area and
the remainder area. The primary and secondary areas are populated by a
configurable amount of windows from the top of the window stack. All remaining
windows will be placed in the remainder area. The windows in these areas are
arranged into a configurable sublayout.

stacktile is highly adaptable and should fit many use cases. The configuration
of the layout is individual per tag set. If the layout values are changed, the
change only applies to the currently focused tag set.
